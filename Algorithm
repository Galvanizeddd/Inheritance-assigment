Create different objects for each shape.
-Rectangle 
-Triangle 
-Circle
-Rhombus.
Ask the user for the desired shape.
Ask the user for the dimensions of their shape.
-Width and Length for rectangle/square
-If the shape is a circle radius
-If the shape is a rhombus length of the 2 diagonals and side length
-If the shape is a triangle base length and height and diagonal lengths
Calculate area and perimeter of the shape with given dimensions. 
-Circle
  -pi*radius**2
  -2**pi*radius
-Rectangle 
  -Length*width
  -2*length+2*width
-Triangle
  -Base length*height/2
  -Diagonal length+diagonal length+base length
-Rhombus
  -Diagonal1*diagonal2/2
  -4*side length
Output the shape, dimensions and the area and perimeter of the shape.
Each output screen will include the shape and the corresponding dimensions along with their perimeter and area
